## Project overview



For our problem, the domain for the electric field 𝑉 is the unit interval 𝑥∈[0,1], with boundary conditions 𝑉(𝑥=0)=0 and 𝑉(𝑥=1)=1. The Laplace equation to solve is

𝑑𝑑𝑥[𝜖(𝑥)𝑑𝑉𝑑𝑥]=0

where the inhomogeneous dielectric constant is (in arbitrary units) given by

𝜖(𝑥)=1+10cos2(2𝜋𝑥)

Use a discretization scheme where the 𝑥 axis will be discretized into 𝑁+1 points, such that 𝑥𝑖=𝑖Δ𝑥, with Δ𝑥=1/𝑁.  

The boundary conditions become 𝑉0=0 and 𝑉𝑁=1.

The discretization of this Laplace equation needs to take into account the 𝑥 dependence of 𝜖. To 𝑂(Δ𝑥2) , this works out as follows:

𝑑𝑑𝑥[𝜖(𝑥)𝑑𝑉𝑑𝑥]𝑥=𝑥𝑖

≈𝜖(𝑥+Δ𝑥/2)𝑉𝑖+1+𝜖(𝑥−Δ𝑥/2)𝑉𝑖−1−{𝜖(𝑥+Δ𝑥/2)+𝜖(𝑥−Δ𝑥/2)}𝑉𝑖Δ𝑥2

This holds for 𝑖>0 and 𝑖<𝑁. 

If we denote by 𝑣 the 𝑁−1-dimensional vector (𝑉1,𝑉2,..,𝑉𝑁−1), we can write the discretized equation as

𝐀⋅𝑣=𝑏

where 𝐀 is an 𝑁−1 x 𝑁−1 "tri-diagonal" matrix, and 𝑏 is an 𝑁−1 dimensional vector (0,...,0,−𝜖(𝑥+Δ𝑥/2)𝑉𝑁/Δ𝑥2) (that is, unless you factor out the common factor of 1/Δ𝑥2).

## Description of files


- `laplacesolver.cpp`: Main executable, takes 1 inputs: N the number of steps along x. The default value is 10000. Stores the value into output.nc file.
- `output.nc`:  Contains the output of ./1dlaplacesolve
- `Makefile`: Allows compiling with  `make` or clean with `make clean` and produces output files: `[name_file].o`, which are used to produced the executable file: `1dlaplacesolver`
- `1dlaplacesolver`: Executable file (see Usage)
- `[name_file]~`: Automatic copy of the file: [name_file].
