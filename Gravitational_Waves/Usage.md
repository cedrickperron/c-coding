# Usage for HW7

## Compilation

`make`  will both generate an executable (grav_waves_main) from the source files.

## Running

`./grav_waves_main`: run the executable and will print the 5 largest correlations between predicted_signals and detected_signals.

`make run`  will print the output of ./grav_waves_main

### CLEANING

To safely remove all executables and .o files, run `make clean` in terminal.
