## Project overview

See description of Assignment 5. Create a laplace solver for a square coaxial cable with V=1 and an outer square boundary with V = 1. 


## Compiler and Libraries

Compiler: g++ 13.2.0


We use the rarray library:

git clone https://github.com/dkirkby/rarray.git

## Background

Lecture notes on Modular Programming. 

## Description of files


- `laplacesolver.cpp`: Main executable, takes 2 inputs: size of the grid, and the threshold. The default values of these parameters are 500 and 1e-6.
- `gridinitialization.cpp`: Create a grid with outer boundaries set to zero and inner boundary set to V = fill_value, a parameter of the function.
- `gridinitialization.h`:  Header file for `gridinitialization.cpp`
- `outputgrid.cpp`: Output the grid (or any other rarray of size NxN).
- `outputgrid.h`:  Header file for `outputgrid.cpp`
- `griditerator.cpp`: Contains a function that updates the value of the gridpoint (i, j) using the average rule, and another function that computes a change_matrix consisting of the change between the value of new gridpoint (i,j) with the old value for the gridpoint (i, j).
- `griditerator.h`:  Header file for `griditerator.cpp`
- `output.txt`:  Contains the output of ./laplacesolver
- `test.txt`:  Contains the output of ./laplacesolver 50 (extra)
- `Makefile`: Allows compiling with  `make` or clean with `make clean` and produces output files: `[name_file].o`, which are used to produced the executable file: `laplacesolver`
- `laplacesolver`: Executable file (see Usage)
- `[name_file]~`: Automatic copy of the file: [name_file].
